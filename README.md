# firefox_css_config
My Firefox CSS config files.




## Setup
Enable userChrome customization in about:config

- Navigate to about:config in the address bar and accept the risks.

- Search for toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets and toggle it to true (by double clicking on it).

Locate and open your profile folder using about:support

- Click on ☰ ➝ Help ➝ "More Troubleshooting Information" or navigate to about:support in your address bar.

- Under Application Basics, click on the the Open Folder button next to "Profile folder". You should now see your profile folder being opened in your file manager.

Some people on on MacOS have had the button open the parent folder of the current profile folder. Make sure the opened folder path matches what is listed in about:support.

- Download my config folder, rename it to *chrome* and put it into the folder you have just opened.

The folder now should contain files and folders like these: bookmarksbackup,browser-extension-data, ***chrome***, settings, prefs.js, and many others.

NOTE: remember to rename folder to "chrome" (without quotes) (ex. "bocchi" > "chrome").
